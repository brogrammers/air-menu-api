=== API v1

This API lets you interact with the system in multiple roles, as a normal user, as an owner, as a staff member
or as an admin.

Each entity has its own rights and can only interact with a part of the system.

The currently logged in user can operate within its bounds, depending on what scopes are associated with the
current access token in use

=== Getting Started

To start, an access token is required, as the whole system depends on the OAuth 2.0 protocol and can only work through it.
Check out the oauth2 docs on how to acquire an access token.

Once an access token has been acquired include it in every request to the API, by adding it to the authorization header
like this:

  Authorization: Bearer 6a44f23504a905b17aa1bdc2682524f48cefcf24e70fb17b8bd...

Now you should be able to perform API calls. Make sure that the acquired access token has the correct scopes to be able to
invoke cerain routes.
